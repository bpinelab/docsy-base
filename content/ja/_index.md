<!-- {{% blocks/lead color="white" %}} Goldydocs provides a single web UI providing
visibility into porridge temperature, chair size, and bed softness metrics! You
can even find out who's been eating **your** porridge.

(Sadly, Goldydocs isn't a real project, but you can use this site as an example
to create your own real websites with [Docsy](https://docsy.dev))
