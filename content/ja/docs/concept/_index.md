## What is it?

The **Strategy** provides the long-term vision and direction for transforming IT
service operations into a fully automated and self-sustaining system. The
**Policy** defines the specific rules and standards that govern the
implementation of this strategy.

### Strategy

The **Strategy** for IT Service Automation, Optimization, and Autonomy focuses
on the following key objectives:

- **Automation**: Automating repetitive and manual tasks to reduce human
  intervention, minimize errors, and increase operational efficiency.
- **Optimization**: Continuously improving IT service performance by leveraging
  advanced monitoring, data analytics, and optimization techniques.
- **Autonomy**: Developing systems that are self-healing, self-optimizing, and
  self-managing to reduce the operational burden and enhance reliability.

The strategy's primary goal is to create an IT service environment that operates
efficiently with minimal manual oversight, allowing the organization to focus on
higher-level strategic initiatives.

### Policy

The **Policy** sets the framework for executing the automation strategy and
ensuring compliance with organizational standards. It includes:

- **Standardization**: Establishing standardized processes for automation to
  ensure consistency across all operations.
- **Compliance**: Ensuring that all automated processes align with regulatory
  and security requirements.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Implementing policies for continuous monitoring
  and reporting on the effectiveness of automated and autonomous systems.
- **Change Control**: Defining rules for managing changes to automated processes
  to minimize risk and ensure stability.

The policy ensures that the strategy is applied in a controlled, secure, and
compliant manner.

## Why do I want it?

This **Strategy & Policy** is essential for organizations aiming to streamline
IT operations, reduce operational costs, and improve service reliability.

### What is it good for?

- **Increased Efficiency**: Automation reduces manual work, freeing up resources
  and minimizing the risk of human error.
- **Cost Reduction**: By automating routine tasks, organizations can achieve
  significant reductions in labor costs and system downtime.
- **Improved Service Quality**: Automated systems respond to issues faster than
  manual processes, ensuring higher uptime and better service levels.
- **Scalability**: Automation and autonomy allow for seamless scaling without
  the need for proportional increases in operational resources.
- **Faster Time to Market**: Automated provisioning and deployment speed up
  service delivery, providing a competitive advantage.

### What is it not good for?

- **Complex Decision Making**: Strategic decision-making that requires deep
  context or judgment may still require human oversight.
- **Unique One-off Tasks**: Some non-repetitive or highly specific tasks may not
  benefit from automation.

### What is it _not yet_ good for?

- **Complete Autonomy**: Although the long-term goal is full autonomy, some
  systems and processes will still require human intervention during the
  transition phase.
- **Cross-Platform Orchestration**: Certain complex integrations between
  platforms or legacy systems may need further development to fully automate.

## Strategic Focus Areas

### 1. Process Automation

- **Goal**: Automate repetitive tasks such as patching, monitoring, and backups.
- **Tools**: Leverage Azure Automation, Terraform, or other orchestration tools
  to streamline processes.
- **Policy**: Ensure that all automation workflows follow the established
  standard operating procedures (SOPs) and comply with security guidelines.

### 2. Data-Driven Optimization

- **Goal**: Utilize data analytics and AI to continuously optimize service
  performance.
- **Approach**: Implement predictive maintenance to address issues before they
  impact service quality.
- **Policy**: Ensure regular data audits to maintain the integrity and accuracy
  of the analytics used for optimization.

### 3. Autonomous Operations

- **Goal**: Develop self-healing and AI-driven decision-making systems that can
  resolve issues without human intervention.
- **Tools**: Use AI to manage resource scaling, workload balancing, and
  real-time optimization.
- **Policy**: Define thresholds for when manual oversight is required, ensuring
  critical systems remain secure and stable.
