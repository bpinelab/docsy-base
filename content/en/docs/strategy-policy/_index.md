This page describes the strategic direction and policies for driving IT service
operations towards automation, optimization, and autonomy.

## What is it?

The **Strategy & Policy for IT Service Automation, Optimization, and Autonomy**
defines the roadmap to transform traditional IT service operations into a fully
automated and self-sustaining system. This strategy focuses on three key areas:

- **Automation**: Transitioning repetitive and manual tasks to automated
  processes, reducing human intervention and errors.
- **Optimization**: Continuously improving the efficiency and performance of IT
  services through the use of advanced monitoring, data analytics, and process
  enhancements.
- **Autonomy**: Evolving IT services to a state of self-healing,
  self-optimizing, and self-managing systems that reduce operational load and
  increase reliability.

The ultimate goal is to create an IT service framework that operates efficiently
with minimal manual intervention, allowing resources to focus on strategic
initiatives rather than day-to-day management tasks.

## Why do I want it?

This strategy is essential for any organization aiming to streamline IT
operations, reduce costs, and increase service reliability. Here's how it
benefits your organization:

- **What is it good for?**:

  - **Increased Efficiency**: Automation reduces manual work, freeing up
    resources and minimizing the risk of human error.
  - **Cost Reduction**: Automation and optimization lead to significant
    reductions in operational expenses by decreasing labor costs and system
    downtime.
  - **Improved Service Quality**: Automated systems can respond to issues faster
    than manual processes, ensuring higher uptime and better service levels.
  - **Scalability**: As the IT landscape grows, an automated and autonomous
    framework allows the organization to scale services without proportional
    increases in operational costs.
  - **Faster Time to Market**: By automating processes such as provisioning and
    deployment, new services and updates can be rolled out faster, giving your
    organization a competitive edge.

- **What is it not good for?**:

  - **Complex Decision Making**: While automation can handle many routine tasks,
    strategic decision-making and context-dependent operations still require
    human oversight.
  - **Unique One-off Tasks**: Certain non-repetitive or highly specific tasks
    may not yet benefit from automation.

- **What is it _not yet_ good for?**:
  - **Complete Autonomy**: While the roadmap includes full autonomy as a future
    goal, some systems and processes may still require human intervention during
    the transition phase. Ongoing advancements in machine learning and AI will
    continue to enhance this area over time.
  - **Cross-Platform Orchestration**: Some complex integrations between
    different platforms or legacy systems may require further development to
    achieve full automation.

## Strategic Focus Areas

1. **Process Automation**:

   - Automate repetitive tasks such as patching, monitoring, and backups using
     tools like Azure Automation, Terraform, or equivalent systems.
   - Implement automated workflows for incident response, change management, and
     routine maintenance using orchestration tools.

2. **Data-Driven Optimization**:

   - Leverage data analytics and AI to continuously monitor and optimize service
     performance.
   - Introduce predictive maintenance practices to anticipate and resolve issues
     before they impact service levels.

3. **Autonomous Operations**:
   - Establish self-healing mechanisms that automatically detect and resolve
     service disruptions.
   - Utilize AI-driven decision-making systems for resource scaling, workload
     balancing, and optimizing configurations based on current demand.
