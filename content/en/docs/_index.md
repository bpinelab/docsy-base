## Introduction

The DocBase Handbook is the central repository for how we operate our services.
As part of our value of homogenization and continuous improvement of our service
operations, the handbook is open to all global team members and we welcome
feedback. Please make a merge request to suggest improvements or add
clarifications.

One thing to note: **The handbook does not contain any personal or confidential
information**. The content containing such information is strictly
access-controlled per role on the internal site. Our handbooks should contain
all our know-how.
